## INSTRUCTIONS

### **THINGS TO THINK OF BEFORE RUNNING **

1.  3D VIEW | DOPE SHEET | OUTLINER **NEED TO BE OPEN**
2. ALL SETTINGS NEED TO BE SET RIGHT F.E THAT GP_OBJECT_NAME IS THE RIGHT NAME OF THE OBJECT
3. THAT YOU'RE START FRAME IS ON A FRAME WHERE A GREASE PENCIL OBJECT EXIST AND THERE IS A STROKE ON THAT FRAME

### SETTINGS

**MODES**

- DEFAULT CREATES FLAT GREASE PENCIL STROKES
  - **GP_OBJ_NAME** THE NAME OF GREASE PENCIL OBJECT YOU WANT TO TURN TO A MESH
  - **REGULAR_LAYER** THE NAME OF THE GREASE PENCIL STROKE LAYER YOU WANT TO TURN INTO PLANES
  - **OUTPUT_COLLETION** THE NAME OF THE COLLECTION YOU WANT TO OUTPUT THE STROKE ANIMATION TO 
  - **SUB_LAYER** THE LAYER THAT I USED TO ADD HOLES IN THE MESHES SHOULD BE FROM THE SAME GREASE PENCIL OBJECT AS THE REGULAR LAYER
